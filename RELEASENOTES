Release 1.0.0
=============

Changes made to the API

.) renaming classes
   All class names have been converted to lower case - this is mostly to 
   reflect the names of the C++ API.

.) group iteration
   Removed the children method - the group object acts like an iterable for 
   itself

.) attribute management
   attributes are no longer managed via special methods but rather via a 
   public attribute named 'attributes' attached to each instance of 
   'nxfield' and 'nxgroup'. See the users guide for more information.

.) change in sementics for nxfile. While in the old release nxfile was 
   basically a descendant of nxgroup (inheriting all its methods and 
   attributes) this is no longer the case. nxfile is a mere handle to 
   the opened file and provides no functionality for data- or
   metadatamanipulation. In order to do anything useful one has to retrieve the 
   root group of the data tree with the root() method of nxfile.
