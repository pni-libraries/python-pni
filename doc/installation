/*! \page installation Installing the Python bindings

Installation of the Python bindings for \c libpninx is rather simple and follows
the standard procedure for Python extensions. 

\section install_sources Install from source code

\subsection install_obt_code Obtaining the code

According to PNI software release policy there are no tarballs with the source
code available. The only way to obtain the source code is via the \c git
repository of the project. The latest stable version can be obtained directly
from the master branch of the repository. To obtain the sources clone the git
repository with
\code
$> git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/libpninxpython/code libpninxpython
\endcode
which clones the repository below the \c libpninxpython directory. 


\subsection install_build Building the Python extension

The installation follows now the standard Python rules. To build and code use
\code
$> python setup.py build 
\endcode
Installation can be done with
\code
$> python setup.py install
\endcode
which installs the Python bindings to the default location of your Python
installation. If a custom location should be used use the \c --home option 
like this
\code
$> python setup.py install --home=/home/eugen/Development/HDRI/install 
\endcode


\section install_binaries Install pre-build binary packages

Binary packages will be available for various Linux Distributions as well as for
OSX and Windows.
