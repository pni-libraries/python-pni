%%%basic introduction to python-pniio

The \pypniio\ Python package provides a binding to the \pniio\ \cpp\ library.
The term binding is not entirely correct. \pniio\ is largely a \cpp\ template
library and thus not all functionality provided by this package is obtained by
simply link to shared object (or DLL on Windows). 
One can consider this package as a kind of \emph{implementation} of the
functionality provided by the templates of the \pniio\ library.

Within the Python universe of the PNI libraries the content of this package is
located below \texttt{pni.io}. The libraries deals with two problems 
\begin{enumerate}
\item read legacy (binary) image and tabular (ASCII) data.
\item provide input and output functions for the Nexus file format. 
\end{enumerate}
where the latter part is the most elaborate one.
