%%%introduction to the python bindings to pninx

This document describes the usage of the Python bindings to \pninx. 
The bindings try to behave as pythonic as possible. 
\pninx\ uses numpy arrays for reading and writing multidimensional data from and
to a file. If you are not familiar with numpy read its documentation first (at
least the chapters describing the basics of array creation and handling). 

Before you can use the Python bindings you need to import the proper package. 
Actually only one physical file format for storing Nexus data is supported:
HDF5.
To import the package use something like this
\begin{verbatim}
import pni.nx.h5 as nx
\end{verbatim}
After this all classes and functions of the \pninx-Python binding are available
under the {\tt nx} namespace.
